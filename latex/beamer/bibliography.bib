	abstract = {The aim of this paper is two-fold: to highlight stylised facts about recent trends in the skill distribution of employment and to analyse the role that technological change might have in explaining these dynamics. Data on industrial employment broken down by occupation recently assembled by the OECD Secretariat are used to examine the changing skill composition of OECD economies, the occupational structure of industry and services, and the dynamics of upskilling. They show that in most OECD countries during the 1980s, employment grew fastest in high-skilled jobs and slowest ‚Äì or declined ‚Äì in low-skilled jobs. The upskilling trend is more apparent in manufacturing than in services, while overall the shift to higher skilled jobs has occurred primarily within industries, rather than between them. Econometric work that explores the role of technology in the changing skill mix in five of the G7 countries in the 1980s shows that upskilling has occurred faster in industries that have ... L‚Äôobjectif de ce document est double : mettre en √©vidence les grandes lignes de l‚Äô√©volution r√©cente de la structure de l‚Äôemploi par niveau de qualification et analyser le r√¥le que peuvent y jouer les mutations technologiques. Les donn√©es sur l‚Äôemploi industriel ventil√©es par profession, r√©cemment r√©unies par le Secr√©tariat de l‚ÄôOCDE, permettent d‚Äôexaminer l‚Äô√©volution de la structure des √©conomies de l‚ÄôOCDE par niveau de qualification, la structure professionnelle des industries et des services et la dynamique du rel√®vement des qualifications. Ces donn√©es font appara√Ætre que dans la plupart des pays de l‚ÄôOCDE, au cours des ann√©es 80, l‚Äôemploi s‚Äôest accru plus rapidement dans les professions hautement qualifi√©es et plus lentement ‚Äì dans les professions peu qualifi√©es ‚Äì lorsqu‚Äôil n‚Äôa pas recul√©. Le rel√®vement des qualifications est plus patent dans les industries manufacturi√®res que dans les services, mais dans l‚Äôensemble cette √©volution au profit des emplois plus qualifi√©s est ...},
