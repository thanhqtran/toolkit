We construct predicted mortality using preintervention mortality rates from various diseases and dates of global interventions. Predicted mortality has a large impact on changes in life expectancy starting in 1940 but no effect before 1940. Using predicted mortality as an instrument, we find that a 1 percent increase in life expectancy leads to a 1.7--2 percent increase in population. Life expectancy has a much smaller effect on total GDP, however. Consequently, there is no evidence that the large increase in life expectancy raised income per capita.},

This study shows that these reforms will find less and less opposition from workers as a consequence of the growth in their life expectancy, as long as it has a greater positive effect on the productivity of the elderly than on the value of leisure.},

Individuals optimally chose the dates at which they leave school to work and at which they retire. Endogenous growth arises thanks to the accumulation of generation-specific human capital. Favorable shifts in the survival probabilities induce longer schooling and later retirement but have an ambiguous effect on per-capita growth. The long-term relationship between fertility and per-capita growth is hump-shaped. Increases in longevity can be responsible for a switch from a no-growth regime to a sustained growth regime and for a positive relationship between fertility and growth to vanish. Solving numerically the equilibrium, demographic changes can have important medium-term effects even if long-term changes are very small.},

Results from different empirical specifications and identification strategies document that the effect is non-monotonic, negative (but often insignificant) before the onset of the demographic transition, but strongly positive after its onset. The results provide a new interpretation of the contradictory existing evidence and have relevant policy implications.},

Individuals have to choose the length of time devoted to schooling before starting to work. We show that it depends positively on life expectancy. Moreover, the effect of life expectancy on growth is positive for economies with a relatively low life expectancy, but could be negative in more advanced economies. The positive effect of a longer life on growth could indeed be offset by an increase in the average age of the workers. Dynamics are characterised by a delay differential equation and human capital converges with oscillations to a balanced growth path.},

Social security has a positive effect on education, but pension benefits favor reductions in retirement age. The net effect is that starting from a benchmark case, higher life expectancies give rise to lower per capita GDP growth in the presence of social security as the share of the active population is reduced. In addition, higher social security contribution rates reduce the growth rate of per capita GDP.},

	abstract     = {This chapter is concerned with the long-term tendencies of paths of capital accumulation that maximize, in some sense, a utility sum for society over an unbounded time span. However, the structure of the problem is characteristic of all economizing over time whether on the social scale or the scale of the individual or the firm. The mathematical methods that are used are closely allied to the old mathematical discipline, calculus of variations. The chapter discusses that the utility function depends on time, as in the standard theory of the calculus of variations. Also the function to be maximized is the sum of utility functions for each period over the future. It is described as a separable utility function over the sequence of future capital stocks and corresponds to the integral of calculus of variations. As the consumption of one period influences the utility of later consumption, the separability assumption is not exact. The treatment of utility in a period as dependent on initial and terminal stocks is not a restriction because the usual assumptions that make utility depend on consumption and consumption on production and terminal stocks implies that an equivalent utility depending on capital stocks exists. The chapter also discusses that the primary sources of the optimal growth model are aggregate savings programs and capital accumulation programs for an economy, the theorems, and methods of the subject find applications in other areas with increasing frequency.},

Using these data, I estimate Vietnamese mortality during the intercensal period using two techniques that rely on age-specific growth rates from two successive age distributions. Intercensal emigration and differential completeness of census enumeration associated with massive outflows of refugees in the wake of the Vietnam War, population-redistribution policies, and a highly mobile population represent important sources of bias for the estimation of intercensal mortality. I incorporate several strategies to minimize bias from these sources and to select the method that is least sensitive to errors associated with them. Life expectancy at birth estimated for the 1979-1989 intercensal period is 61.4 years for males and 63.2 for females. These results suggest a trend of declining mortality between the 1970s and the 1980s and add solid empirical evidence to the debate over whether mortality in Vietnam has been deteriorating or improving.},

To do so, we extend the standard two-overlappinggenerations growth model to allow for endogenous labor participation in the later period of life. We show that the rate of participation declines as the size of social security system increases. We also show that mandatory early retirement many be socially desirable in case of underaccumulation.},

In addition, this paper assumes that labor productivity depreciates. Under this setting, socially optimal allocations are examined. The first-best allocation is an allocation that maximizes welfare when a social planner distributes resources and forces an old agent to work and retire as she wants. The second-best allocation is one that maximizes welfare when a social planner can use only pay-as-you-go social security in a decentralized economy. This paper finds a range of an old agent's labor productivity such that the first-best allocation is achieved in a decentralized economy. This finding differs from that in Michel and Pestieau [``Social security and early retirement in an overlapping-generations growth model'', Annals of Economics & Finance, 2013], which notes that the first-best allocation cannot be achieved in a decentralized economy.},

The poor availability and reliability of national account data as well as the fact that self-employed---whose labor income is hard to capture---account for a major share of the workforce and often work in the informal sector render its computation difficult. Consequently, measuring the labor share requires assumptions. I consult social accounting matrices in addition to national account data to gain information on the production structure and self-employed incomes in developing countries. The final data set covers about 90 developing countries from 1990 to 2011. The data suggest that the finding of declining labor shares of previous studies also applies to the sample of low and middle-income countries. Furthermore, I find the labor share in developing countries to be about one-half in size and hence less than the standard ``two-thirds'' in economic literature.},
