	abstract = {We exploit the major international health improvements from the
1940s to estimate the effect of life expectancy on economic performance. We construct predicted mortality using preintervention mortality rates from various diseases and dates of global interventions.
Predicted mortality has a large impact on changes in life expectancy
starting in 1940 but no effect before 1940. Using predicted mortality
as an instrument, we find that a 1 percent increase in life expectancy
leads to a 1.7--2 percent increase in population. Life expectancy has
a much smaller effect on total GDP, however. Consequently, there is
no evidence that the large increase in life expectancy raised income
per capita.},
